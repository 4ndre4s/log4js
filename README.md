Log4js
======

Log4js - The Logging Framework for JavaScript

## Development
To build the JavaScript library we use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) and [grunt](https://gruntjs.com/). 

````
cd log4js
npm install
grunt build
````

Include then the `target/log4js.min.js` file in your project.

More details in the [Wiki](https://github.com/stritti/log4js/wiki/Development)

## Contribution

Pull Requests are very welcome.

## Other JavaScript Logger
There are a lot other projects which are started logging in JavaScript:

There is a very active fork of current log4js framework modified for node.js usage: https://github.com/nomiddlename/log4js-node

Further loggers could be found (and added!) in the [Wiki](https://github.com/stritti/log4js/wiki/JavaScript-Logger).
